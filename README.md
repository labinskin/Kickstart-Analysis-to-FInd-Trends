# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
## Overview

**Purpose of the Project**

Our friend Louise wants to launch a Kickstarter campaign for a play she wants to put on. She has contacted us to analyze Kickstarter data that was collected from 2009 to 2017. The data set is large, including data on the goal, amount pledged, country, date launched/completed, and number of backers, being among the data most pertinent to this analysis. Louise would like us help her understand and plan her campaign. She believes it is critical to understand when campaigns are launched, the type of campaign, including unique campaigns, and how campaigns for plays, her interest, faired. This analysis is intended to help Louise understand the fundamentals of Kickstarter campaigns, provide insight about launch dates and the success or failure of plays. From this analysis, we hope to impart Louise with the necessary knowledge to launch a successful campaign.
